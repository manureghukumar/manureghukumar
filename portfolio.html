          </h5>
          <p class="mt-1" align="justify">Independent mobility is core to being able to perform activities of daily living by oneself. We have implemented a low cost brain controlled prosthetic leg, which uses EEG signals from brain to control prosthetic leg. The EEG signals are obtained
            using a device called” Mindwave”. The electrode in the head gear is used to obtain raw brain signals. The EEG power spectrums obtained using Mindwave is then processed using a microcontroller and control signals are produced. The alpha and
            beta signals play a prominent role for controlling voluntary muscles. They are processed for providing control action. The head gear and microcontroller can be connected using Bluetooth. The control signals from the microcontroller can be
            used to control an electric motor.</p>

          <p class="mt-1" align="justify">The laptop will be charged automatically based on the real time status of the laptops battery. The laptop's charger will be switched on and off based on the battery status provided the charger is always plugged in. The real time battery status
            is monitored using an ATtiny 85 through an USB to TTL circuit The status is wirelessly transmitted using a 2.4GHZ transceiver arrangement. Finally the charger is switched ON &amp; OFF based the status received. This system can be used on any
            LINUX based platforms and the battery health is monitored. The UI and associated data acquisition were done using python libraries. This system enhances the battery life and makes the system more user friendly at a very low cost.</p>

          </h5>
          <p class="mt-1 text-justify">This project aims to solve todays problem among manual transmission in cars. In this study, a gear shifting mechanism was designed and applied to make the shifting process faster and less difficult for the driver. This device provides a solution
            towards the difficulty in operating gears in manual transmission cars. This system incorporates an electromechanical system which can be attached to the existing gear shifter without altering the existing system and also provides an option
            to use the existing manual shifting as such according to the desire of the driver. The system also includes a PID control mechanism to determine the gear stick motion and also to optimize the performance of the car at varying driving conditions.</p>

          <p class="mt-1 text-justify">The aim of the project was to integrate the process stations present into a Distributed Cotrol System for academic learning purpose. &nbsp;A low cost wireless DCS was setup using a Arduino-LabVIEW based arrangement. The data acquisition and
            transmission were done using Arduino while the process control and computation were done using LabVIEW. The wireless transceiver by Nordic Semiconducctor nRF24L01 was used in the project. The hardware prototyping was done and the project was
            successfully implemented.</p>
